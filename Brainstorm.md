Key Ideas to pursue:
- ease-of-use (do not assume financial literacy)
    - many budgeting apps assume a level of financial literacy and/or favor flashy at-a-glance info
    - use some sort of simple graphical structure to show where money comes in and goes out, how it's split, etc
    - use a hierarchy to allow implied importance
- flexibility (do not require that user adopts highly specific behaviors to use effectively)
    - try giving option for range on expected ($UNIT_TIME)-ly income
        - this will give user idea of min and max capabilities
    - also try allowing for by-time and persistant buckets (helps to show savings)
    - do not do things automatically unless the user wants them done automatically
        - have a lot of contextual settings (have them near thing prompting option & in settings menu)
- Portability (make a program capable of running on most systems, i.e. a webapp or similar)
